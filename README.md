# Microclimate Sample - Vote microservice

Originally this application was Microservices Builder Sample. See the [sample documentation](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.microservicebuilder.docs) for more information.

Currently this can be used as Microclimate Sample because pom.xml, server.xml, manifest.yml and etc. were modified to support Microclimate Java Liberty.
